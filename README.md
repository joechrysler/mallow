# I wanted to stop using my browser...
just to **post a quick message to Campfire**. So I used a fantastic ruby example of the campfire API and built myself a script that posts simple text to 
a Campfire room. No frills, no muss, no fuss.

## mallow simplifies chat
you can call it **with quotes**  `mallow "Inspiring thoughts that aren't limited to alphanums"`

**or without**  `mallow No frills`

just call it  `mallow and get back to work`

## there's a tiny bit of configuring to do
rename recipe-example to recipe and add your own uri and campfire api-key.
